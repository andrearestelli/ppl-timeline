% Define a parfind (parallel find) operation, which takes a list of lists L and a value x, and parallely looks for x in every list of L â€“ the
% idea is to launch one process for each list, searching for x. If x is found, parfind returns one of the lists containing x; otherwise, it 
% returns false.
% E.g. parfind([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[4,5,9,10]], 4) could return either [4,5,6] or [4,5,9,10]; parfind([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[4,5,9,10]], 7) is false.

parfind(LOL, X) ->
    lists:foreach(fun(L) ->
                spawn(?MODULE, find, [self(), L, X])
            end, LOL),
    receive
        {found, L} -> L
    end.

find(Pid, L, X) ->
    case lists:member(X, L) of
        true -> Pid ! {found, L};
        false -> ok
    end.

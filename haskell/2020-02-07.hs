-- Consider a data type PriceList that represents a list of items, where each item is associated with a price, 
-- of type Float:

data PriceList a = PriceList [(a, Float)]
-- 1) Make PriceList an instance of Functor and Foldable.

pmap f z (PriceList ls) = PriceList (map (\x -> (f (fst x), (snd x) + z)) ls)

instance Functor PriceList where
    fmap f pc = pmap f 0.0 pc

instance Foldable PriceList where
    foldr f z (PriceList ls) = foldr (\x y -> (f (fst x) y)) z ls

-- 2) Make PriceList an instance of Applicative, with the constraint that each application of a function in the
-- left hand side of a <*> must increment a right hand side valueâ€™s price by the price associated with the 
-- function.
